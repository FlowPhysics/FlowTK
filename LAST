   has problem.
   The problem is that the reader only read one file, but it should read two files at least for TimeStep[0] and TimeStep[1].

3- Working on Converting Intervals to Indices

4- In Reader::RequestData at line 613 till 618.
   We set OutputTimeSteps to UpdateTimeSteps. Not all the time they are equal. First, in RequestInfoirmation the UpdateTimeSteps should be processed to see which file indices needed to be read. Then Find time steps of those files and set them in output time step. This can be done in a separate function, that called inside RequestInformation. In RequestData we can use the processed data, instead of re-calculate it again.

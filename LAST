1- Interpolator::SpatioTemporalInterpolation:1182
   the Velocities array name may not be: DataVelocities

2- Interpolator::886
   InputDataObjectsArray[UpdateTimeStepIntervalIndex+1],
   has problem.
   The problem is that the reader only read one file, but it should read two files at least for TimeStep[0] and TimeStep[1].

3- First Problem: In Seed
   In Seed > InitializeTracers() the NumberOfSeedPoints are 64, for 4x4x4 grid. But the number of "TracerCounters" is 15 (line 1070 of Seed.cxx). 
   Either the seed grid intersection gives 15 points or something is wrong.
   In both cases, only 15 number of tracerers should shpw up in FlowMap. But flowmap again uses 64 tracers. If 15 is corect in Seed, the 15 tracers should be used in FlowMap.

4- Second Problem: Interpolator
   Run the code. We see that FlowMap uses "UpdateInputFilter". It calls Interpolator and execution goes to Interpolator.
   Now, in Interpolator > Request Data, at line 817, we used TIME_STEPS from input. This is not defined in previous filter yet! This is definitely NULL.
   Next, RequestData calls a function "Interpolate". There we have segmentation falut.
